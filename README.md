# lncn

Lncn is a simple python CLI that counts the SLOC (source lines of code) in a file or directory.

To install, simply run `pip install lncn`. Make sure the `Scripts/` directory in your python installation is on the PATH.

Once installed, you can run `lncn /path/to/dir/or/file`. Optionally, you can pass files or directories to ignore with the `-i` / `--ignore` flag.
